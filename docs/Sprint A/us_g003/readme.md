## 3. Analysis

ANTLR can be used to analyze and process various structured data formats, such as XML, JSON, YAML and others.

Some scenarios in which it can be used:
-> Developing compilers, interpreters and transpilers.
-> Designing and implementing programming languages.

In general, ANTLR simplifies the process of language recognition and analysis.
